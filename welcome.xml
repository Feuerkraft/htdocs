    <p>
      Feuerkraft is (or better: 'will be') a 2d top-down tank battle
      game. You will be able to control many different kinds of
      vehicles, change them or simply walk around with your own feet.
      The game will provide a story driven single player mode with
      some simple adventure like elemets (rescue somebody, talk to
      people, collect a key, steal a car, etc.) and in addition it
      will also provide a multiplayer mode which will be something
      similar to the game 'Firepower' or 'Return Fire', which means
      basically defend your base against the enemy. Since I consider
      single player much more important than multiplayer, single
      player will come first and multiplayer has to wait. There are
      also plans for providing cooperative multiplayer missions.
